*Your goals as a Frontend developer*
 
My main goal as a frontend developer in training is to learn the skills required to build  website from top to bottom without relying too much on outside resources. What I will end up doing with these skills is still up in the air. I have several interests that could guide my future career in frontend development. I am a soccer player with a degree in political science and enjoy gaming in my spare time. Any of these interests could push me towards a path in which I could utilize my learned skills as a frontend developer. 
 
I could help companies that train soccer players create a website that is good for advertising purposes and for scheduling training times. This website could include sections for feedback from the trainers and the customers to make a more personalized training session that the client will be able to gain skill from. It could have a feature that emails a coach of a certain player and asks for their input on the player as well. I currently work for a soccer training company that has a website for advertising and contact purposes, but they pay another company for a website that clients use to schedule time slots and also doubles as the trainers schedule and indicates to us who is to be training which session at which time. To combine both of these websites, and maybe add several other features that neither website currently has, would likely benefit the company.
 
 I could potentially use my degree in political science to help create websites that would assist individuals in a political campaign. Every new candidate that decides to run for office is going to need their own website to accept feedback and to be able to advertise their campaign. The fact that every new candidate is going to need one of these websites will mean that the demand for these websites will constantly be there. A website is a great place for a politician to post their platform or to endorse a platform of one of the main political parties. It is also a good way to convince prospective voters to vote for the candidate in any upcoming election.
 
 I could also potentially use the my enjoyment of gaming to drive me to help create an advertising website for a game or help create a game that is run on a browser. Many new games that are available on the market do not come from the largest game companies, but instead come from smaller independent companies. This means that there is always a need for advertising websites to help get the name of the game out to the public. I am still developing the skills needed to pursue these avenues, but hopefully I can use my skills to create something that I enjoy and am passionate about.
